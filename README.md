# AudioSinGAN-MastersThesis

Please see this link: https://github.com/LPfantz/AudioSinGAN

I felt it was important to have my thesis project stay a fork of the original SinGAN. I also wanted to keep my fork of SinGAN with minor bugfixes only. I created this placeholder repo to link to my other github account where my Thesis work is stored.
